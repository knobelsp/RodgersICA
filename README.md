This is a python notebook implementation of the Rodgers Information Content Assessment (ICA) technique. See RodgersICADemo.ipynb for a demonstration, and RodgersICA.ipynb for a stripped down version of the code ready for use.

This effort was initiated by Kirk Knobelspiesse (kirk.knobelspiesse@nasa.gov) as part of the SQOOP marine microplastic observation project, headed by Heidi Dierssen, University of Connecticut (https://colors.uconn.edu/), with funding from NASA.
